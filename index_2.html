            But if I could live forever teleporting many places over and over, would I still be "me"?
            Maybe teleportation doesn't give me eterner life, but even not existing, Because of nothing there that can be called ego.
            Therefore, "me" is a paradox that is not immortal, and has never existed. So teleportation is actually just moving my physical body.
            The rest gives just extra meaning. Will your ego still exist? If we could teleport together, wouldn't we just exist psychologically? Ego is an illusion, just movement, and flow...<br><br>

        ‚ú¶ This may be the first step of teleportation.
        As tepleportation is sending information of my atoms,
        I have to measure my physical body info. When I fill sign-up sheet in a new website, there is <div class="tooltip">some personal questions and answers.üñºÔ∏è<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="securityquestion.png" alt="image"></a></span></div>
         It exists incase I forget your password in the future, the answers identify it‚Äôs real "me",
        not hackers or aliens. I found this would be the similar step with teleportation to confirm real me. Sometimes my memory is rusty what the answer was though... <br><br>

        ‚ú¶‚ú¶ As we use the Internet univers, we risk the threat of rich association in our thinking. It is true that the Web itself is a network, but hyperlinks that relate bits of online information are not like synapses in our brain. The link to the Web is just an address and is just a simple software tag that guides the browser to another separate information page. They did not have the organic abundance or sensitivity of our synapses. Ari Schulman wrote that the connections in the brain "does not simply provide access to memory, they constitute memory in most cases." The connections created by the Web are not ours, and no matter how much time we spend on searching and surfing, the web's connections will ever be ours. When outsourcing memory to machines, we also outsource the most important part of intelligence or identity. "The connection is truly an accident," William James said in 1892 at the end of a lecture on memory. If you add one more word to this, you can say, "Connection is truly ego."<br>

          <i>‚ú¶ "There are two kinds of knowledge. One is that we know a subject directly, and the other is where the relevant information is."
          Samuel Johnson, 04.18. 1775</i><br>
          The Internet has given us rapid access to an unprecedented library of information in terms of its size and scope. The Internet allows us to conveniently sort through this library so that we can find something that is not exactly what we are looking for but at least meets our immediate purpose. What the Internet is shrinking is the first kind of knowledge Johnson has said. The ability to know ourselves deeply, the ability to build a rich and unusual series of associations that allow original knowledge to rise within our thoughts.
          Perhaps Samuel Johnson is right. But Johnson's second knowledge may be developing more because of the Internet. I have benefited a lot since last year thanks to the search function of Yale Digital Library and the library link system. Among them, "Borrow Direct" is a feature that allows users to check whether or not they have any material in the Yale Library and receive it by courier service from other linked universities in the United States. Even if I don't get the data I want right away, it's very useful to know where the data is now. Sounds like a function that fits Johnson's earlier statement of "right away purpose." Perhaps while the first knowledge is being "reduced," the second knowledge is becoming more and more "expansionary."

        <td><strong>Teleporting Step #3: dissociate yourself & make a map of dissociated atoms...</strong><br><br>
          ‚ú¶ How do we map information when using the Internet? I sometimes look for a TED video YouTube video about how not to be nervous because I have trouble talking to people or talking to them in public. It's a video that I watch to get useful information for me, but when I finish watching the video, I often can't remember what it's about... So I need to do now? I just thought that my concentration would be poor. However, passive viewing of video over the Internet is said to be the least active in sympathetic nerves. The idea that sympathetic nerves are not activated is that our brains get numb while watching the lecture. That's because the video only provides information "in one way" and we just listen (in fact, most of the time we're thinking about something else). Also, after watching the video, I don't map with direct or indirect actions such as searching for a book about the contents or writing, so the information doesn't map inside of me, but just hover around me.<br><br>
          ‚ú¶‚ú¶ The influx of different messages that we receive every time we are online does not overload our working memory alone. This makes it difficult for the frontal lobe to focus on only one object. The process of strengthening memory cannot begin at all. And thanks to the plasticity of neural channels, the more we use the Internet, the more our brains are trained to become more distracted, which processes information very quickly and efficiently, but it is impossible to concentrate continuously. This helps us understand why many of us find it hard to focus on one thing even when we're away from the computer.

          ‚ú¶ My old collegue has ackward experience. He needed to sent his income tax and all the finantial infos a few years ago via e-mail to the finantial team. But somehow-he probably too busy by dealing with something-he did cc the attachment with all workers in our agency, which was over 100 people... He should've be cautious when he was about to hit a "sending" buttom. It was so embarrassing and shouldn't happen again.<br><br>
          ‚ú¶‚ú¶ Socrates may have been mistaken about the effects of writing, but he was wise to warn us against taking memory‚Äôs treasures for granted. His prophecy of a tool that would ‚Äúimplant forgetfulness‚Äù in the mind, providing ‚Äúa recipe not for memory, but for reminder,‚Äù has gained new currency with the coming of the Web. The prediction may turn out to have been merely premature, not wrong. Of all the sacrifices we make when we devote ourselves to the Internet as our universal medium, the greatest is likely to be the wealth of connections within our own minds. It‚Äôs true that the Web is itself a network of connections, but the hyperlinks that associate bits of online data are nothing like the synapses in our brain. The Web‚Äôs links are just addresses, simple software tags that direct a browser to load another discrete page of information. They have none of the organic richness or sensitivity of our synapses. The brain‚Äôs connections, writes
Ari Schulman, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt merely provide access to a memory; they in many ways constitute memories.‚Äù The Webs connections are not our connections‚Äîand no matter how many hours we spend searching and surfing, they will never become our connections. When we outsource our memory to a machine, we also outsource a very important part of our intellect and even our identity. William James, in concluding his 1892 lecture on memory, said, ‚ÄúThe connections is the thinking.‚Äù To which could be added, ‚ÄúThe connecting is the self.‚Äù <br>

          ‚ú¶ Have you ever had <div class="tooltip">a Chat RouletteüñºÔ∏è<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="iTxPW.jpg" width="300px" alt="image"></a></span></div>? Chat Roulette is a service that randomly selects chat partners when accessing a site that provides chat services. So, it is not used to meet a particular person and talk to them, but rather to relieve boredom while chatting with an unspecified stranger. It seems to be a place where many people speak of themselves differently from real sex, and are likely to behave differently from their actual personalities, because they cannot tell what age or gender they will meet. This happens frequently on SNS such as Twitter as well as random chatting. It has become very difficult to grasp a person's personality based on what he or she posted on Twitter. I have a friend who posts on Facebook very often, and his real personality is very quiet. There are also the opposite. How would a person's personality shown as a chat window on the Internet, "back-stage personality" be different from his real personality, "front-stage personality"? Maybe they're turning themselves into content and "running" online. Are you making a reality show that makes you a star and reflects their real lives? What can we know from them? What do you not know? What should I believe? How should we react?<br>
          <br>
          ‚ú¶‚ú¶ similar thought of broadcasting myself <br>
Just because popular social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, encourage members to use their actual identities doesn't mean people are presenting themselves online the way they do in real life.
Some psychologists and sociologists who have studied usage habits on Twitter, Facebook and popular dating sites say there's little correlation between how people act on the Internet and how they are in person.
Research into how personality traits are filtered through the Web, especially the new breed of short-message online services, is slim, but digital-health experts have observed numerous transformations when someone ascends the Internet's world stage. Whether a person is overly chatty or arrogant on Twitter doesn't necessarily reflect on how he or she acts in the real world.
"I don't think that you could have any type of accurate or even semi-accurate personality analysis based on what people are writing in their Twitter streams. Probably the same case goes for Facebook statuses as well," said John Grohol, an online mental health expert and founder of PsychCentral.com.
"It could be the opposite. It could be that the shyest person is the person who tweets the most," Grohol said. "There has not been anything like Twitter or Facebook status updates before."
Online, people tend to exaggerate their personas because they have much more time to revise and calculate the content they present than in spontaneous face-to-face interactions.
"The persona online may be much more fabulous, much more exciting than the everyday life that they're leading," said Julie Albright, a digital sociologist at USC, "because they see everybody else doing it."
Twitter, in many ways, has become a personal broadcast medium.
"It has turned people into mini-broadcasters," Albright said. "It makes them in a way stars of their own reality shows."
Albright points out that actions online can, however, influence real-life behavior. A new batch of followers on Twitter could translate into a more positive outlook.
"They can go back to their lives and have a boost of confidence," she said.<br><br>
‚ú¶‚ú¶‚ú¶ To be frank with you about new technology, more commonly speaking, progress, is that we should be sensitive not only to gains but also to losses. We should not let our hands be blinded by internal surveillance of the possibility that the glory of technology could paralyze our core egos.</div>
